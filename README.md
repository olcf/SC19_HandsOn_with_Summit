# Welcome to the SC19 Hands-On with Summit session!

This repository contains the materials for the *[Hands-On with the Summit Supercomputer](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=pec111&sess=sess412)* at SC19.


### What is Summit?
Summit, located at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) in Oak Ridge, TN,  is the [world's most powerful supercomputer](https://www.top500.org/system/179397) dedicated to open scientific research. It has lots of unique architectural features that we'll explore today, including:

- IBM POWER9™ CPUs (x 9,216)
- NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs (x 27,648)
- Single-Node performance of 42TF (x 4,608)
- Node-local Memory / "Burst Buffer" of 1.6TB/Node
- Total System Memory >10PB DDR4 + HBM + NVME

### Navigating this Session
Here you will find the [session agenda](agenda.md) along with various resources
to help get you up and running on Summit. We'll take a deep look at the
system's design, discuss how research teams write programs for and run
workloads on Summit, and you'll get to run your own. The session is guided by
hands-on [***challenges***](challenges). 

The [first challenge](./challenges/Access_Summit_and_Clone_Repo) is to
successfully log into Summit and clone this repository.

Each challenge has its own sub-directory under `/challenges/`, and includes a
README.md file and any additional files for that challenge. Challenges range in
difficulty from introductory to very complex, and may require research and
reference materials outside of what's provided in this repository.

##### *P.S. Be on the lookout for giveaways hidden throughout!*
